# This script creates an identity CA for testing by doing the following:
# - Generating a private key for the CA
# - Use the key to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
# - Create an identity certificate for the CA and self-sign w/ private key
# - Deploy the public idenity CA certificate to the apps/deployall folder
#
# After running this script, you will be able to create and sign identity
# certificates for your DDS applications.  

# DDS_SECURE_DEMO_HOME environment variable must be set before running
