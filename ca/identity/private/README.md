This directory contains the private key for the Identity CA.  A real CA would 
likely be disconnected from the Internet.  It is critical in a real CA that
the CA's private key be protected as anyone with the key can generate 
identities that appear to be valid to anyone else relying on the Identity CA
as their root of trust.
